# Visibility and Navigation on iOS Home Screen

**ID: US-BTC-102**

Description: In the iOS app, the home screen has been enhanced to display important information that aids in navigation and security configuration. If you have not yet set up the app, a prompt will appear encouraging you to configure "Locations" and "Apps." When Street Protection is turned on or off, the map will display your current location and indicate whether you are in a "Safe Location" or not. A main switch will clearly show whether the protection is active, helping you easily understand the security status and access additional settings.
