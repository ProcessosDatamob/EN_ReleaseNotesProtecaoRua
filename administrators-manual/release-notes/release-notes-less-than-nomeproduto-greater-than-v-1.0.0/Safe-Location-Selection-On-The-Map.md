# Safe Location Selection on the Map

**US ID:** **US-BTC-93**

**Description:** In the Street Protection app, it is possible to choose a safe location by tapping directly on the map, which helps to define safety areas visually and accurately, even without knowing the exact address. When you tap on the map, a marker appears showing the address information. You can also search for a specific address and adjust the map's zoom level to better view the area. If you choose not to save, the marker disappears. This functionality provides an easy and flexible way to set up safe locations.
