# Safe Locations Management in the Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-87**

In the Street Protection app, you can easily add, edit, and remove safe locations to define your protection areas. On the "Locations" screen, you can adjust the address of a safe location using the map, change the name of the locations, or remove them, always needing to confirm the deletion. You can add up to 20 safe locations; when this number is reached, the button to add new locations disappears. If you delete a location, the button reappears, allowing new locations to be added. This functionality gives you more control over the safety areas within the app.
