# Redirect URI Configuration for OAuth

**ID: US-BTC-65**

In the Street Protection app, it is important to configure the Redirect URI "street-protection://oauth-callback" to ensure that login via OAuth functions correctly. This URI is essential for authorization requests and should be used as the "redirect_uri" when performing the login process. The correct configuration of this URI must be clearly specified for providers using OAuth integration, ensuring that the authentication flow proceeds smoothly.
