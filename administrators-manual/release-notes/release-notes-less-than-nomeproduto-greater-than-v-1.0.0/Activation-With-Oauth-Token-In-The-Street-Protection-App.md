# Activation with OAuth Token in the Street Protection App

**US ID: US-BTC-72**

In the Street Protection app, you can activate your access using an OAuth token. When you authenticate with a valid token, you receive an access_token and a refresh_token, which allow you to access the app's functions. If the access_token expires, you can use the refresh_token to obtain a new one. If any issue occurs while attempting to activate, a message will appear indicating that there was a failure. The app activation also allows you to switch devices without losing access, ensuring that you can continue to use the app normally with the new deviceId.
