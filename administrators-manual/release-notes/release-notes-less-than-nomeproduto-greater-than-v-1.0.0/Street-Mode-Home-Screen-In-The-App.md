# Street Mode Home Screen in the App

**ID: US-BTC-109**

Description: When you open the Street Mode app, the first screen that appears allows you to configure the apps you want to protect. On this screen, you will see a welcome message and simple instructions to select the apps, along with a map showing your current location and address. At the bottom of the screen, there are buttons like "Home," "Places," and "Apps" that facilitate navigation between the app's sections. The "Home" button returns you to this home screen without reloading it, while the "Places" and "Apps" buttons allow you to access your specific lists. This bottom area maintains the same style across all screens, ensuring you always have easy and intuitive navigation.
