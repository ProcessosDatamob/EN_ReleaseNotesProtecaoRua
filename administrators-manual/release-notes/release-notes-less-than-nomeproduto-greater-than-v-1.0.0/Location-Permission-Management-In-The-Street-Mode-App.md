# Location Permission Management in the Street Mode App

**ID: US-BTC-6**

In the Street Mode app, users can decide whether or not to share their location for the app to function correctly. When tapping "Continue," a window appears asking if you want to "Allow Once," "Allow While Using the App," or "Don't Allow." Choosing "Allow While Using the App" means the app will have access to your location whenever it is open. The "Allow Once" option grants access only while you are using the app in that specific session. If you choose "Don't Allow," the app will display a screen explaining how to grant permission should you change your mind, and it will take you to the device's Settings so you can change this manually.
