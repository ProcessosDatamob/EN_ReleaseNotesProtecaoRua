# Unlock Screen with Password Validation

**ID: US-BTC-125**

Description: In the Street Mode app, whenever you reopen the application or leave it unused for 10 seconds, you will need to enter a 6-digit password to access it again. You can only enter numbers in this field. If you enter the correct password, you will be able to access the app normally. If you enter the wrong password on the first attempt, a message will appear stating that you have two attempts remaining. If you make another mistake, you will be warned that if you make one more mistake, access will be blocked for 24 hours.
