# Emergency Security Configuration in the App

**US ID: US-BTC-129**

**Description:** In the app, you can set up an emergency password and add a trusted contact for dangerous situations. By accessing the Passwords and Access section, you can create an emergency password that, when used, will send an alert via SMS to the trusted contact you choose. The process is simple and consists of three steps: first, add the trusted contact; then, create an emergency password; and finally, complete the setup. If the password you create does not meet the required criteria, such as having at least 6 digits and not being composed of sequential numbers, an error message will appear. Once the setup is successfully completed, you will receive a confirmation, providing an extra layer of security for you.
