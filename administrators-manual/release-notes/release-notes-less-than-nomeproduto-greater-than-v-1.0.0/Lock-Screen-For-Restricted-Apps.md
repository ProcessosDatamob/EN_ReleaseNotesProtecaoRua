# Lock Screen for Restricted Apps

**ID: US-BTC-114**

Description: When you are using Street Mode and attempt to access a blocked app outside the safe zone, a screen will appear informing you that the app is not available at that moment. This helps clarify usage restrictions and prevents app X from being opened in unauthorized locations, ensuring you understand why you cannot use it there.
