# Safe Locations Management and App Lock in Street Mode

**ID: US-BTC-127**

In the Street Mode app, you can add or modify safe locations and control which apps are locked. When you are outside a safe location, you need to confirm your actions using Face ID or a password. Inside safe locations, this confirmation is not required. To turn Street Mode on or off, you always need to use both the password and Face ID. If you are in danger, you can use an emergency password to automatically send your location via SMS to a chosen emergency contact.
