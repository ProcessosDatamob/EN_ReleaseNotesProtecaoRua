# Removal of the Street Mode Onboarding Welcome Screen

**US ID: US-BTC-7**

After the user activates Street Mode via SMS, they will no longer see the onboarding welcome screen. This makes the process more straightforward and easier, as it eliminates the need to learn about Street Mode before setting it up. By clicking "Start," the user will be taken directly to the Permissions screen, making the experience faster and simpler.
