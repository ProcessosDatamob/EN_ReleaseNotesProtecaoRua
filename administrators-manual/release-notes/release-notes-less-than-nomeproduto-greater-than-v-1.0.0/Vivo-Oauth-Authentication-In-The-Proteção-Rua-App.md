# Vivo OAuth Authentication in the Proteção Rua App

**ID: US-BTC-58**

In the Proteção Rua app, you can log in using the Vivo OAuth option, which allows you to access information about your phone line. When you choose this option, you will be taken to a screen to authenticate. If you authorize the access, you will return to the app with a code that validates this authorization. If you decide not to proceed, you will return to the previous screen without your information being shared. If any issues occur during the redirection process or in the exchange of the authentication code, the app will display an error message and suggest that you try again.
