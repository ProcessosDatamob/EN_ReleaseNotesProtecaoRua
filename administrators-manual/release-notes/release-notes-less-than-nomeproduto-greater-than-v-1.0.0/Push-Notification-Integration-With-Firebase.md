# Push Notification Integration with Firebase

**ID: US-BTC-67**

In the Proteção Rua app, we use Firebase to send and receive push notifications in a practical and efficient manner. Once the SDK is configured, the app connects to Firebase, registering devices so they can receive system messages. Notifications appear to the user regardless of whether they are using the app at the time or not, and by tapping on the notification, they are taken directly to the relevant screen within the app. Additionally, we log operational information to identify and fix potential issues, ensuring the app operates without any unpleasant surprises.
