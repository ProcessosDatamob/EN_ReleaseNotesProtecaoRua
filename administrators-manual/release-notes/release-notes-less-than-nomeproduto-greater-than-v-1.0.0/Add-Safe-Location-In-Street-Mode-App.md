# Add Safe Location in Street Mode App

**US ID: US-BTC-96**

In the Street Mode app, when you set it up for the first time, you have the option to add a safe location where your apps operate without restrictions. After allowing the initial settings, a screen appears presenting the possibility to add this safe location. You can choose to add the location at that moment or postpone this action, proceeding to the initial screen that encourages registration. The screen design is clear and adapts well to any type of device, ensuring that the information is easy to understand and access.
