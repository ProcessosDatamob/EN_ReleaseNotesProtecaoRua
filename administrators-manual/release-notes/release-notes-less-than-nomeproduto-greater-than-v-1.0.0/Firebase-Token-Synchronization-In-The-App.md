# Firebase Token Synchronization in the App

**User Story ID: US-BTC-141**

When you open or activate the app, the Firebase token is sent to our server. If you have used the app before, your backup information will be automatically loaded when you enter Street Mode. If it is your first time, you will be directed to Street Mode without any prior information. If there is an issue sending the token, you will see options to retry or return to the start. If the submission is successful, you will go directly to Street Mode. Otherwise, after several unsuccessful attempts, an error message will appear, and if necessary, you will be taken back to the activation screen.
