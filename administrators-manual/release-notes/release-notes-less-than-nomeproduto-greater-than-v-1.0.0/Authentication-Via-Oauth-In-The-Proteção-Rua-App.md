# Authentication via OAuth in the Proteção Rua App

**US ID: US-BTC-70**

In the Proteção Rua app, you need to enter an authentication code from Vivo to access your phone line information. If the code is accepted and you have only one line, the data will be saved automatically. If you have multiple lines, you will need to select which one you want to activate. If the code is not valid or if any issue occurs, you will see clear error messages to help you understand what happened.
