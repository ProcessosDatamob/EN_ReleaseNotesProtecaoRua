# App Access Restriction in Street Mode

**ID: US-BTC-121**

In the Street Mode app, you can choose which apps will have access blocked when you are outside of locations considered safe. This helps protect your privacy and keep your data secure. First, you define what those safe locations are, and then select the apps you want to protect. If you prefer, you can continue with other settings or postpone this choice and return to the home screen, where you will be encouraged to complete the process. The interface automatically adjusts to different devices, ensuring that you always have the same easy-to-use experience.
