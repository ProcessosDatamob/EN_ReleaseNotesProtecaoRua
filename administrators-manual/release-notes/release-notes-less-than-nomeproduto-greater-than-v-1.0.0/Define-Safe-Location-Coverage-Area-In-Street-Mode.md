# Define Safe Location Coverage Area in Street Mode

**ID: US-BTC-95**

Description: In the Street Mode app, you can choose a safe location where your apps operate without restrictions. To do this, access the safe location registration screen and use the slider bar to adjust the size of the desired area. Enter an address so the map is centered on that point and move the marker to mark the center of your safe area. After defining the area, tap "Continue" to proceed with the configuration. If you change your mind or need to exit, you can close the screen at any time to cancel the operation.
