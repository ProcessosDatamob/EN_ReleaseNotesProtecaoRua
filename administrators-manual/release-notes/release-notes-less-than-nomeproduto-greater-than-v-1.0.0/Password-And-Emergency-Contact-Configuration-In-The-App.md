**ID: US-BTC-129**

As an app user, you have the option to set up a special password and designate an emergency contact to enhance your security in risky situations. To do this, go to the Passwords and Access screen and choose the "Create emergency password" option. In this section, you can add the phone number of a trusted person and create a 6-digit emergency password, which should not be sequential numbers. When this password is used, your contact will automatically receive an SMS message, alerting them about the situation. After entering the phone number and creating the password, complete the procedure to ensure your contact is prepared to be notified in case of an emergency.
