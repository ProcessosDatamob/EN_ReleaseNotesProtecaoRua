# Pending Permissions Notification in the App

**ID: US-BTC-391**

Description: When you open the app for the first time or after an update, you will see a "Pending Permissions" notice on the home screen if you have not yet granted all the necessary permissions. If you try to access "Locations" or "Apps," a window will appear showing which permissions still need to be granted, along with a button that takes you directly to your device's settings. After adjusting the permissions and returning to the app, the window will only show the permissions that have not yet been granted. If all permissions are granted, this window will no longer appear.
