# License Status Management in the App

**ID: US-BTC-506**

The Street Protection app adjusts its functionality according to the user's license status. When the status is ACTIVE, the user can access all features, such as managing addresses and using apps without restrictions. If the status is INACTIVE, the user remains logged in but will encounter limitations on some functions and will see a message indicating that the license is inactive. In the case of the status being LOGOFF, the user is automatically logged out and taken back to the login screen, with the session being removed from the device.
