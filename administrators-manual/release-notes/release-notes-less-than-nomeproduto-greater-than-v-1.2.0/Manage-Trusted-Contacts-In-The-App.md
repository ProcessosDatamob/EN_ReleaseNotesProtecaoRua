# Manage Trusted Contacts in the App

**US ID: US-BTC-483**

In the "Street Protection" app, you can easily edit or add trusted contacts from the "Manage and Change Passwords" screen. If you already have a saved contact, you can update it or add a second contact, expanding your personal safety network. To edit, simply enter a new number or choose one from your address book and confirm. To add a new contact, fill in the necessary details and confirm the addition. In both cases, the app will display a message to confirm that the action was successful. If an invalid number is entered, the app will show an error message. If you close the screen without confirming, the changes will be discarded.
