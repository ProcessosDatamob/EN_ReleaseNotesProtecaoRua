Description: In the Street Protection app, you can update the information of a trusted contact to ensure it is always correct. To do this, go to the password management screen and select "Edit trusted contact." Choose the contact you want to update and enter the new number manually or select a number directly from your address book. After confirming the update, a message will appear informing you that, in case of an emergency, an SMS with your location will be sent to this updated contact. To complete the process, click "Finish," and you will be taken back to the main screen. If you decide not to make the change, you can return without saving the changes made.
