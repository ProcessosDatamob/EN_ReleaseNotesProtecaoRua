# Change Main Password in the Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-416**

In the Street Protection app, you have the option to change your main password by navigating to the "Manage and change passwords" screen and selecting the change option. Simply enter a new 4-digit password, confirm it, and click "Confirm" to update. If the passwords entered do not match, an error message will appear. If you wish to cancel the change, you can return to the previous screen without saving the changes. When the update is successfully completed, a confirmation message will be displayed, and you will be redirected back to the main password management screen.
