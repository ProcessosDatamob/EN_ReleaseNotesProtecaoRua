# Switch Behavior on Home

**US ID: US-BTC-550**

Description: In the portal, when you use the switch on the home screen, the state change occurs instantly, without the smooth "Fade in and out" transition animation. This means that when you turn the switch on or off, there is no gradual effect that typically makes the transition visually more pleasant.
