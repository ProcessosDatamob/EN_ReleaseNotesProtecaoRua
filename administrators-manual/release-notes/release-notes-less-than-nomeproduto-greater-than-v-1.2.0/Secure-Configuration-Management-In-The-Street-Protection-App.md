# Secure Configuration Management in the "Street Protection" App

**ID: US-BTC-442**

In the "Street Protection" app, to ensure security, any attempt to perform important actions, such as changing the "Switch Master" or managing protected locations and apps, requires the entry of a 4-digit password. This ensures that only authorized individuals can make these changes. If the password is incorrect, the changes are blocked and an error message is displayed. Additionally, if the emergency password is used, an SMS alert is automatically sent to the user's trusted contacts, accompanied by specific actions. All of this contributes to greater protection and control of the user's data and apps.
