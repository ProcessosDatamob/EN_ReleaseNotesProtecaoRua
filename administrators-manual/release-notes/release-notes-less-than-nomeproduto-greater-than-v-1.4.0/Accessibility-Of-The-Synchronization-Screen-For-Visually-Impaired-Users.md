# Accessibility of the Synchronization Screen for Visually Impaired Users

**ID: US-BTC-453**

Description: In the portal, the "Synchronizing your information" screen has been improved to assist visually impaired individuals. When the screen reader is enabled, it skips non-essential images, reads the header "Synchronizing your information" as an important title, and describes the progress as "Loading." All elements on the screen are clearly identified, making it easier for users of assistive technologies to understand and effectively use the screen.
