# Accessibility in the Safe Location Options Modal

**ID: US-BTC-360**

Description: In the Street Protection app, the options window for safe locations has been improved to accommodate users with special needs. It is now fully accessible for those using screen readers, allowing anyone to easily navigate and perform actions such as editing, renaming, or deleting safe locations independently. Each component is clearly announced, with identifiers like "Close window," "Edit address," "Rename location," and "Delete," all recognized as buttons, which facilitates interaction on Android and iOS devices.
