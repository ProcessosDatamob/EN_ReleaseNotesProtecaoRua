# Accessibility on the Pending Permissions Screen

**ID: US-BTC-470**

Description: In the portal, the "Pending Permissions" screen has been enhanced to be accessible to visually impaired users. It is now possible to navigate using a screen reader in an orderly and logical manner, making it easier to find and activate the necessary permissions. Each component on the screen is clearly described with semantic identification, ensuring that users can navigate independently and intuitively.
