Description: In the portal, the "Pending Permissions" screen has been adjusted to enhance the experience for users with visual impairments. With the use of a screen reader, navigation is now easy to follow, with a clear and logical order. Each element on the screen is described in an understandable manner, with precise identification, allowing users to recognize and activate permissions independently. This significantly improves accessibility and usability, ensuring that everyone can interact with the screen efficiently.
