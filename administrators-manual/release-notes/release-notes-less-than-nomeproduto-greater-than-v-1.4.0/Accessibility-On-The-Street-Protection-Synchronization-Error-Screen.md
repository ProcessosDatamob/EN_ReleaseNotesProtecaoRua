# Accessibility on the Street Protection Synchronization Error Screen

**ID: US-BTC-450**

The synchronization error screen for Street Protection on the portal has been enhanced to ensure that all users, including those using screen readers, can access it without difficulties. Now, the elements on the screen are presented in a logical sequence, making it easier to understand the error and the options available for the user to choose from. Each interactive button and link has a clear and precise description, and the screen reader can correctly identify the type of each element, such as buttons or text fields. These improvements ensure efficient navigation through the screen and provide all users with an inclusive and barrier-free experience.
