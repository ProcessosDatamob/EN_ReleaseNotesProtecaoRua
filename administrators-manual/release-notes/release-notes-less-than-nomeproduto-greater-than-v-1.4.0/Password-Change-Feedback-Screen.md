Description: Now, when you access the password change screen on the portal, there is a feedback section that clearly informs you about the status and outcome of the process. This means that when you attempt to change your password, you will receive instant confirmation about the success or failure of the operation, making the experience more intuitive and quicker. This new functionality enhances the efficiency of using the system, ensuring that you immediately know whether your password has been successfully changed or if any corrections are needed.
