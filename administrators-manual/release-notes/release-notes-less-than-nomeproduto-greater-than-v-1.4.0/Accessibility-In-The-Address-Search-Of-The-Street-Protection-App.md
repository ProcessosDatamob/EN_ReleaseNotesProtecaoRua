# Accessibility in the Address Search of the Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-367**

The address search screen in the Street Protection app is designed to be fully accessible. Users who require special support can use screen readers to navigate easily, with a logical sequence and clear descriptions of elements such as buttons and text fields. Each part of the screen is identified so that the screen reader can correctly announce what each element does and what its content is. This ensures that all users can search for addresses efficiently and independently.
