# Accessibility for Visually Impaired Users

**ID: US-BTC-472**

Description: On the portal, the "How to Prevent Street Protection from Being Uninstalled" screen has been adapted to be accessible to visually impaired users. All elements of the page now follow a logical navigation sequence. The component descriptions are clearer and use easy-to-understand language. Additionally, the different types of components are accurately identified, allowing users who rely on screen readers to understand and interact with the page independently and effectively.
