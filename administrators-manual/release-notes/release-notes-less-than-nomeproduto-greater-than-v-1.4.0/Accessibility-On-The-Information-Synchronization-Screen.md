# Accessibility on the Information Synchronization Screen

**ID: US-BTC-453**

Description: In the portal, the "Synchronizing your information" screen of Street Protection has been enhanced to be more inclusive for visually impaired users. When a screen reader is in use, it does not mention the decorative image, focuses on the header as an important title, and describes the loading icon as a progress indicator with a clear explanation. This way, users who utilize assistive technologies can understand and use all the elements on the screen more easily.
