# Accessibility on the Information Synchronization Screen

**ID: US-BTC-453**

In the Proteção Rua app, the "Synchronizing your information" screen has been enhanced to be more accessible to users with visual impairments. With the screen reader activated, purely decorative images are ignored, and the header is presented as a level 2 heading, facilitating navigation. The progress indicator is clearly explained so that users know the synchronization is in progress. All components of the screen are identified in a way that allows for simple and effective interaction with assistive technologies.
