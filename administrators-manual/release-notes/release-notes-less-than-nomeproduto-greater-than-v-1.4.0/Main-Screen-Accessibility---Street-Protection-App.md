# Main Screen Accessibility - Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-346**

The Street Protection app has been enhanced to be fully accessible to users with disabilities, making the main screen easy to use without obstacles. Navigation is more natural, with a focus that follows an intuitive sequence. Screen readers are now able to announce clear descriptions of each element on the screen, including the current status of the Master Switch. Elements are identified in a way that works well with assistive technologies. Additionally, switching between tabs is simplified, allowing keyboard use, and there is clear audio feedback indicating which tab is currently selected.
