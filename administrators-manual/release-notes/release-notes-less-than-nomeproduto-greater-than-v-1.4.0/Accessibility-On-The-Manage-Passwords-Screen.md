# Accessibility on the Manage Passwords Screen

**ID: US-BTC-464**

Description: In the portal, the "Manage and Change Passwords" screen has been adjusted to better accommodate visually impaired users. It is now possible to navigate logically using screen readers, which describe the elements clearly and comprehensibly. This facilitates the identification and use of the different components, allowing users to manage their passwords and contacts independently and effectively.
