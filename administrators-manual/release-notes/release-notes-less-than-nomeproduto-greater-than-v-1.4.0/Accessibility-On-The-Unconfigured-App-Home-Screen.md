# Accessibility on the Unconfigured App Home Screen

**ID: US-BTC-348**

The app's home screen, when not yet configured, is designed to be easily accessible for users with disabilities. Navigation is intuitive and follows a logical sequence, whether using a keyboard or other sequential navigation methods. Screen readers can clearly describe each element present on the screen and automatically identify the types of components being used. If "Street Protection" is turned off, the screen reader informs the user by saying "Street Protection deactivated. Configure your protections" when this element is in focus. This ensures that all users can understand and interact with the home screen effectively and clearly.
