# Accessibility in the Safe Location Options Modal of the Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-360**

The Street Protection app now offers a safe location options window that is fully accessible for users with special needs. Navigation in this window is easy and organized for users who utilize screen readers, ensuring that as they move through the elements, the focus sequence is correct. Buttons such as "Close window," "Edit address," "Rename location," and "Delete" are clearly announced by screen readers and are correctly identified as buttons on both Android and iOS devices. This facilitates the independent and efficient editing, renaming, and deletion of safe locations.
