# Profile Screen Accessibility for Visually Impaired Users

**ID: US-BTC-463**

The Profile screen of the portal has been updated to provide a better experience for visually impaired users. When a screen reader is used, navigation now follows an intuitive order, which helps in understanding the information clearly. Each component on the screen is described in a way that makes sense and is correctly identified, such as the "Log Out of My Account" button. This ensures that important actions, like creating passwords or logging out, can be performed without needing assistance, providing more autonomy and ease for all users.
