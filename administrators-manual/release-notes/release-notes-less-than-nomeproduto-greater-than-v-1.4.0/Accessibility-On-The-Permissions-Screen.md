# Accessibility on the Permissions Screen

**ID: US-BTC-452**

The permissions screen in the Proteção Rua app has been enhanced to be more accessible to users who utilize screen readers. Now, navigation between elements occurs in an orderly manner, aiding in the comprehension of the content. Each interactive part has an easy-to-understand description and is correctly identified by its type, which helps the user make informed decisions about the necessary permissions.
