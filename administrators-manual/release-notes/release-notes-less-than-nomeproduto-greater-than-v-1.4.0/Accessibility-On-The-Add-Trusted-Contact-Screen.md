# Accessibility on the Add Trusted Contact Screen

**ID: US-BTC-461**

Description: On the portal, the "Add a Trusted Contact" screen has been adjusted to better accommodate users with special needs. Now, the elements on the screen are organized in a way that follows an easy-to-understand and use sequence. Assistive technologies, such as screen readers, provide clear and useful descriptions of each part of the screen, allowing users to identify everything correctly. This facilitates the addition of trusted contacts, even when errors or warnings appear, ensuring that everyone can use this functionality without difficulties.
