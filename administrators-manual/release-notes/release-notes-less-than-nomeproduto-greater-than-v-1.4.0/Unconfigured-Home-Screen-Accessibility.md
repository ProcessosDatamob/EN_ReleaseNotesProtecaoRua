# Unconfigured Home Screen Accessibility

**ID: US-BTC-348**

**Description:** In the application, the home screen that has not yet been configured is fully accessible to people with disabilities. Navigation through the elements is organized and intuitive, allowing users to use the keyboard or other navigation methods sequentially without difficulties. Screen readers provide clear descriptions of the elements on the screen and automatically identify the types of components. When the "Street Protection" feature is disabled, the screen reader announces "Street Protection disabled. Configure your protections" as soon as the user focuses on this element, which aids in the user's understanding and navigation of the screen.
