# Accessibility on the Street Protection Feedback Screen

**ID: US-BTC-462**

Now, in the app, the feedback screen for the "Street Protection" setting is adapted for use by visually impaired individuals. This means that when using screen readers, navigation is done logically, where each element is easily recognized and clearly explained. As a result, users can complete the configuration independently and safely.
