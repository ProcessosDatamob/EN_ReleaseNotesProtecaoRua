# Accessibility in Main Password Change

**ID: US-BTC-465**

Description: In the portal, the functionality to change the main password is now more accessible for visually impaired users. Navigation through the screen follows a logical order, ensuring that all elements can be accessed sequentially with a screen reader. The components are clearly described and have appropriate semantics, allowing users to easily understand the password requirements and interact safely and independently.
