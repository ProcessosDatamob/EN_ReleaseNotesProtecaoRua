# Accessibility in Trusted Contact Editing

**ID: US-BTC-469**

Description: In the portal, the "Edit Trusted Contact" screen has been improved to ensure that visually impaired individuals can use it easily and independently. Now, the screen works well with screen readers, meaning all elements are presented clearly and in order, facilitating navigation. Each part of the screen is correctly described and identified, so the user knows exactly what they are doing. Additionally, any important notification is announced immediately, allowing users to make changes to the trusted contact safely and without difficulties.
