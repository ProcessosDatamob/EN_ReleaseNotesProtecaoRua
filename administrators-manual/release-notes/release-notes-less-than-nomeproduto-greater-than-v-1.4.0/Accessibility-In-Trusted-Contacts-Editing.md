Description: On the portal, the "Add second trusted contact" screen has been enhanced to ensure that all users, including those with special needs, can add or edit contacts easily and intuitively. It is now possible to navigate clearly and logically using the keyboard or screen readers, as all elements are identified in a meaningful way and have accurate textual descriptions.
