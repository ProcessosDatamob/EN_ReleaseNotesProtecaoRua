# Accessibility on the "Manage Safe Locations" Screen

**ID: US-BTC-370**

Description: In the Street Protection app, the "Manage Safe Locations" screen has been enhanced to be fully accessible to users who rely on assistive technologies. Navigation is logically organized, and components are clearly described by screen readers, allowing buttons and tabs to be announced with their accurate names and states. All elements are properly identified, ensuring that individuals with accessibility needs can manage their safe locations independently and effectively.
