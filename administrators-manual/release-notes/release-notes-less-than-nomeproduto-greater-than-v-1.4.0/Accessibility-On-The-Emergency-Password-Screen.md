# Accessibility on the Emergency Password Screen

**ID: US-BTC-458**

Description: In the Proteção Rua app, the screen where you create and confirm your emergency password has been improved to assist visually impaired users. Now, screen reader users can hear the elements in the correct order and clearly understand what each one does, as the descriptions are clear and specify the type of component. If there is any error, you will be immediately informed, making the experience easier and smoother for those using assistive technologies.
