# Accessibility on the Emergency Password Screen

**ID: US-BTC-457**

Description: In the Proteção Rua portal, the Emergency Password details screen is now more user-friendly for visually impaired individuals. When the screen reader is active, all elements are read in a way that makes sense, each part of the screen has a clear description and is correctly identified. This makes it easier for those using assistive technologies to understand and interact with the screen.
