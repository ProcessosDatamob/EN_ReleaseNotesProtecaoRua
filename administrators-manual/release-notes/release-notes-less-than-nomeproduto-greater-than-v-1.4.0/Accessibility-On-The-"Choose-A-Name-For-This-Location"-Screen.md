# Accessibility on the "Choose a Name for This Location" Screen

**US ID: US-BTC-358**

Description: In the Street Protection app, the "Choose a Name for This Location" screen has been enhanced to ensure that all users, especially those with special needs, can use it easily. Navigation is intuitive, and screen readers clearly describe each part of the screen, such as buttons and tabs, with precise explanations. Elements like "Close window" and "Save name" are identified as buttons, while options like "Home" and "Work" are announced with their selection state. When the "Other" option is selected, the text field is automatically highlighted, and the virtual keyboard appears, allowing users to interact independently and efficiently.
