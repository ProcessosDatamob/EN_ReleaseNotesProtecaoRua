# Accessibility on the "Choose a Name for This Location" Screen

**US ID: US-BTC-358**

Description: In the Street Protection app, the "Choose a Name for This Location" screen has been enhanced to be fully accessible to all users, including those with special needs. Navigation is now easy and intuitive, with clear descriptions that work well with screen readers, allowing anyone to name locations independently. When the "Other" option is selected, the focus is automatically directed to the text field, and the virtual keyboard is displayed, making the process simpler and more accessible. All of this ensures that the experience is user-friendly and inclusive for everyone.
