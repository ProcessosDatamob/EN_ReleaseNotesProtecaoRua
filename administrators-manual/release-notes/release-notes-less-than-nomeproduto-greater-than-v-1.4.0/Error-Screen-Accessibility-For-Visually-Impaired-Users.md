# Error Screen Accessibility for Visually Impaired Users

**ID: US-BTC-473**

In the application, the error screen displaying the message "Something went wrong here" has been enhanced to be more user-friendly for visually impaired users. Now, navigation through the elements on this screen follows a logical order, component descriptions are clear and easy to understand, and component types are correctly recognized. This helps the user understand what happened and decide whether to try again or return to the start, all independently, using a screen reader.
