# Accessibility for Contact Selection

**ID: US-BTC-468**

In the portal, visually impaired users can access the contact selection screen for editing more easily. Navigation on the screen has been improved to follow a logical order, where each element is clearly described. This helps users correctly identify the types of components present, ensuring they can choose and modify contacts on their own, without needing external assistance.
