# Accessibility on the Synchronization Error Screen

**US ID: US-BTC-450**

**Description:** In the Street Protection app, the synchronization error screen has been enhanced to be accessible to users who utilize screen readers. Now, the elements on the screen are presented in a logical order, making it easier to understand what is happening. Each interactive part comes with clear descriptions, and the screen reader correctly identifies the type of each item. This helps users quickly understand what the problem is and what options are available to fix it, making the process of resolving synchronization errors more efficient.
