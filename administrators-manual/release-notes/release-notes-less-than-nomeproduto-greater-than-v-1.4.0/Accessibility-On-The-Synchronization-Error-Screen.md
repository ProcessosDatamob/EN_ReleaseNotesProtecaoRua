# Accessibility on the Synchronization Error Screen

**ID: US-BTC-450**

In the Proteção Rua app, the screen that appears when there is a synchronization error can now be easily used by people who rely on screen readers. The elements on the screen are organized in a logical manner, making navigation easier. Each clickable button or item has a clear description, helping users understand what each one does. Additionally, the types of elements, such as buttons or warning messages, are correctly identified, which aids in understanding what went wrong and what the options are to resolve the issue.
