# Accessibility on the Password Feedback Screen

**ID: US-BTC-467**

Description: We have improved the password change feedback screen to make it more accessible for visually impaired users. With a screen reader, navigation now flows logically, and each component is clearly described, allowing for correct identification. This ensures that the success message when changing the password is easily understood, even without visual support.
