# Accessibility on the "Define Safe Area" Screen of the Street Protection App

**User Story ID: US-BTC-354**

The "Define Safe Area" screen of the Street Protection app can now be easily used by people with special needs. When a screen reader is activated, navigation is logically organized, and each component is clearly announced, allowing users to define safe areas on their own. The elements on the screen are clearly identified, ensuring that assistive technologies can recognize and accurately describe each component, such as buttons and sliders. This makes the experience more inclusive and easier for everyone.
