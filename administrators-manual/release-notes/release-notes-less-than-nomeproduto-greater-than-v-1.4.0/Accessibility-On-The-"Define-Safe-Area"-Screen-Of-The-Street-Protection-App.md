# Accessibility on the "Define Safe Area" Screen of the Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-354**

The "Define Safe Area" screen of the Street Protection app has been enhanced to ensure that all users, including those with special needs, can use it with ease. Now, navigation between the different elements on the screen flows intuitively, and the descriptions of the elements are presented clearly for screen readers. Additionally, the components on the screen have identifiers that aid the use of assistive technologies. This way, users can define safe areas independently and efficiently, without complications.
