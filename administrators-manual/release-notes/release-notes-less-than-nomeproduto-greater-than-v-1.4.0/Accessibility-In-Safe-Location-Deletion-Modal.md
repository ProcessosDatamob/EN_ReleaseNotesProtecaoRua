# Accessibility in Safe Location Deletion Modal

**ID: US-BTC-362**

In the Street Protection app, the confirmation window for deleting a safe location is now more user-friendly for people with special needs. It works well with technologies that assist with accessibility, ensuring that everything, such as buttons and titles, is correctly identified by screen readers. This allows anyone to confirm or cancel the deletion of safe locations independently, making the user experience more pleasant and autonomous.
