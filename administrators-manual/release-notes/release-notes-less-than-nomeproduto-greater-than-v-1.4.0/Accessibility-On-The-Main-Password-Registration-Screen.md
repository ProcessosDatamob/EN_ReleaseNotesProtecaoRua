# Accessibility on the Main Password Registration Screen

**ID: US-BTC-455**

Description: In the Proteção Rua app, the screen where you set and confirm your main password is now more accessible for visually impaired individuals. With the help of assistive technologies, the elements on the screen are read in an organized and logical manner, and each component has clear descriptions. This ensures that you can enter your password with a full understanding of the necessary validation criteria. This improvement enhances usability and interaction for all users.
