**ID: US-BTC-455**

Description: In the Proteção Rua app, the screen where you create and confirm your main password has been enhanced to assist users with visual impairments. Navigation between the different elements on the screen follows a logical sequence, and all component descriptions are clear and understandable when read by assistive technologies. This ensures that all users can enter their passwords correctly and understand the validation requirements easily and independently.
