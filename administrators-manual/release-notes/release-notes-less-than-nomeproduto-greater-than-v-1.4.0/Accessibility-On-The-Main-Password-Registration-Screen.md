# Accessibility on the Main Password Registration Screen

**ID: US-BTC-454**

Description: In the Proteção Rua app, the screen where you create your main password has been improved to assist users with visual impairments. Now, when you activate the screen reader, it reads the items on the screen in an organized and easy-to-understand manner, making navigation simpler. Each part of the screen has a clear description and is correctly identified, allowing users with visual impairments to navigate and set their passwords independently and securely.
