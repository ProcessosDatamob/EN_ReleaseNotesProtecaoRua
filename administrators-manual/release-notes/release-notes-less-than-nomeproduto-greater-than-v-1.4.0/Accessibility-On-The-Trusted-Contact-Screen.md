# Accessibility on the Trusted Contact Screen

**ID: US-BTC-460**

Description: In the portal, users who require accessibility features can easily add or edit a second trusted contact on the specific screen, which has been designed to be accessible. Navigation through the elements is logically organized, with a clear sequence to move between items, as well as detailed descriptions and correct identification of component types. This facilitates effective and clear management of trusted contacts, especially for those using assistive technology, such as screen readers.
