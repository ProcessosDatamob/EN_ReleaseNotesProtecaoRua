# Accessibility on the Trusted Contact Screen

**ID: US-BTC-459**

The "Add a Trusted Contact" screen has been developed to be accessible to everyone, including people with special needs. The buttons and links are organized in a way that makes it easy to navigate and understand what each one does. Users of screen readers or other assistive tools will find clear and precise descriptions of the elements on the screen, facilitating interaction and comprehension. Each part of the screen has a clear name that explains its function, helping users know exactly what to expect when interacting with it.
