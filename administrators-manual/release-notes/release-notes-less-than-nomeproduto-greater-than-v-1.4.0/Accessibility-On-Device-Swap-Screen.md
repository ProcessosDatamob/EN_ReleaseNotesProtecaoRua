Description: In the Proteção Rua app, the device swap screen has been enhanced to be more accessible. Now, users who utilize screen readers can easily navigate this screen, as the elements are presented in a logical order. Additionally, the component descriptions are clear, which helps in understanding what each part of the screen does. The interactive components are also well-identified, making interaction easier and more intuitive for everyone.
