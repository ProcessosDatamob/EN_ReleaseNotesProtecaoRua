# Accessibility on the "Add Safe Location" Screen

**US ID: US-BTC-352**

The "Add Safe Location" screen in the Street Protection app has been enhanced to ensure that all users, including those using assistive technologies, can easily use it. Navigation is now done in a logical sequence, allowing the user's focus to move correctly between the different elements on the screen. Each part of the screen is clearly described by screen readers, and the types of components are correctly identified, enabling users with special needs to add safe locations autonomously and effectively.
