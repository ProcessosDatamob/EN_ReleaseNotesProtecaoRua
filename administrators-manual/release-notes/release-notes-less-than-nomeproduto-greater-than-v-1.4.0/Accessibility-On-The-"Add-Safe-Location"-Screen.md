# Accessibility on the "Add Safe Location" Screen

**US ID: US-BTC-352**

The "Add Safe Location" screen in the Street Protection app has been enhanced to be more accessible for users with special needs. Now, the elements on the screen follow a logical navigation order, making it easier for screen readers to use. Each item on the screen has clear descriptions that are read aloud, and the types of components are easily recognized, providing a more autonomous and efficient experience for all users.
