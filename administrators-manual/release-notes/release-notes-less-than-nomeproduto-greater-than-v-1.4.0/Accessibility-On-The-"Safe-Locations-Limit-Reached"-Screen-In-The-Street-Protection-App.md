# Accessibility on the "Safe Locations Limit Reached" Screen in the Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-372**

The "Safe Locations Limit Reached" screen in the Street Protection app has been enhanced to be fully accessible to users with special needs. Navigation is now logical, allowing screen reader users to easily understand all screen elements. The "Frequently Asked Questions" button is properly identified by these readers, and all texts and titles are announced with their complete descriptions, facilitating understanding. The components on the screen are clearly identified so that all users can interact with the available options independently and without difficulty.
