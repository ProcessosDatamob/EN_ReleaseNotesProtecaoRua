# Accessibility on the "Safe Locations Limit Reached" Screen

**ID: US-BTC-372**

The "Safe Locations Limit Reached" screen in the Street Protection app has been enhanced to be easily used by people with special needs. Now, when you use screen readers, everything is read in a sequence that makes sense, making it easier to understand the available information and actions. The "Frequently Asked Questions" button and informational texts are clearly announced, helping you navigate the app clearly and independently.
