# Accessibility on the "Safe Locations Limit Reached" Screen

**US ID: US-BTC-372**

In the Street Protection app, the screen that notifies you when you have reached the "Safe Locations Limit" has been updated to be fully accessible. This means that users with special needs can navigate this screen without assistance. The navigation sequence is logically planned, making it easier to use screen readers. Components such as the "Frequently Asked Questions" button and the texts explaining the situation are clearly described. All elements on the screen are identified so that buttons and texts are easily recognized and work well with assistive technologies.
