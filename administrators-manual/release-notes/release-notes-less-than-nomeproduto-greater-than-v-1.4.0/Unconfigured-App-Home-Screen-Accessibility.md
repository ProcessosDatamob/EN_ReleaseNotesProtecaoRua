# Unconfigured App Home Screen Accessibility

**ID: US-BTC-348**

The app's home screen, when not yet configured, is now fully accessible for users with disabilities. It is possible to navigate logically using the keyboard or other sequential methods, and screen readers announce clear descriptions of the elements. Each component is properly identified, and the status "Street Protection disabled" is provided to help the user understand that they need to adjust their protections. This ensures that the user can immediately perceive the current state of the app and easily access the necessary settings.
