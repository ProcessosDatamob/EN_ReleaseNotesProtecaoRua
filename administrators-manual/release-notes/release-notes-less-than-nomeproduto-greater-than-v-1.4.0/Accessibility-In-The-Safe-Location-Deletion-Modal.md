# Accessibility in the Safe Location Deletion Modal

**ID: US-BTC-362**

In the Street Protection app, the confirmation window for deleting a safe location has been enhanced to be fully accessible to users with special needs. Now, navigation is clear and organized for those using screen readers, ensuring that each part, such as buttons and titles, is correctly announced. This provides an autonomous and safe experience for users when deciding whether to confirm or cancel the deletion of a safe location.
