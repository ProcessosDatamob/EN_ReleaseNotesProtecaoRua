# Accessibility in Creating Main Password

**ID: US-BTC-454**

Description: In the Proteção Rua app, the screen where you create your main password has been improved to assist visually impaired users. Now, navigation using screen readers is logically organized, meaning that elements are presented in the correct order. Additionally, each part of the screen has clear descriptions, making it easier to understand and interact with them. This ensures that all users can easily create their passwords, even when using assistive technologies for accessibility.
