# Main Screen Accessibility in the App

**ID: US-BTC-346**

The <ProductName> app is designed to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. On the main screen, navigation is straightforward as the elements are presented in a logical order, making it easy to understand. Screen readers clearly describe what each element is and its function. When the "Street Protection" status changes, this information is announced immediately. Additionally, it is possible to switch between the different tabs of the app using the keyboard, receiving an audible alert indicating which tab is currently active. This ensures that everyone has a simple and unobstructed user experience.
