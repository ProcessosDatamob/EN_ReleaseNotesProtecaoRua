# Update Available Notification

**ID: US-BTC-540**

Description: When you open the Street Protection app, it automatically checks if a new version is available. If so, you will receive a notification suggesting an update to take advantage of security and performance improvements. If the app is already on the latest version, you will not see any notification. This ensures that you are always informed about important updates without being unnecessarily interrupted.
