# Missing Permissions Notification in the App

**ID: US-BTC-523**

Description: After completing the initial process in the Street Protection app, if any important permissions are still missing, you will receive a notification informing you that it is necessary to grant them for the app to function fully. If there are communication issues, the app will attempt again up to three times. If all permissions have already been granted, you will not see any notification. Additionally, if the Notification permission has not been granted, a warning will be displayed indicating that notifications are disabled.
