In the Street Protection app, you will receive notifications about adjustments and permissions that need to be made to ensure your apps are properly protected. On the home screen, a bell icon will indicate when there are unread notifications. When you tap on notifications related to pending permissions or settings, you will be directed to the screens where you can easily make these changes. Additionally, some notifications may prompt you to add safe locations or update the app in the app store.
