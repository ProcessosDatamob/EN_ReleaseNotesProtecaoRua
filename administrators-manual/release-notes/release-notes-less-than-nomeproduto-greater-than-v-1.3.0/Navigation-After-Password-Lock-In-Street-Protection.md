# Navigation After Password Lock in Street Protection

**ID: US-BTC-515**

Description: In the Street Protection app, when the main password is locked, the user receives clear instructions to create a new password or return to the app's home screen. If the user attempts to use the locked password again, the app will display a message informing about the lock, along with a timer indicating how much time is left until the lock is released. This ensures that the user can continue using the app safely and without complications once the lock issue is resolved.
