# Trusted Location Registration Suggestion in the Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-534**

In the Street Protection app, if you enter the default password more than 10 times in a specific location on the same day, you will receive a notification suggesting that you add this location as trusted. This makes access easier in the future, as it eliminates the need to enter the password in places you visit regularly and consider safe.
