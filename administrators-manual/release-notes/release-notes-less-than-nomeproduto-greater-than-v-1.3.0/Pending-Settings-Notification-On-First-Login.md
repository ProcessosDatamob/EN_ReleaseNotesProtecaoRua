# Pending Settings Notification on First Login

**ID: US-BTC-526**

Description: When you log in to the Street Protection app for the first time, you will be notified if there is anything that still needs to be configured, ensuring that everything is ready for the app to function correctly. If everything is already configured, you will not see any notification. Once you finish making the necessary configurations, the notification will disappear. If there is any issue in removing the notification, the app will retry up to three times, with longer intervals between each attempt.
