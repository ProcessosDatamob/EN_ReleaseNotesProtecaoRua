# Password Attempt Management in Street Protection

**ID: US-BTC-513**

In the Street Protection app, if you enter the main password incorrectly, you will have up to three chances to get it right. After the first and second incorrect attempts, messages will appear to warn about the error and inform how many attempts remain, allowing you to try again. If you make a mistake on the third attempt, a message will notify you that a lockout is imminent. If you use all attempts unsuccessfully, you will be taken to a screen that informs you about the temporary lockout. On this screen, you will have the option to create a new password or return to the home screen.
