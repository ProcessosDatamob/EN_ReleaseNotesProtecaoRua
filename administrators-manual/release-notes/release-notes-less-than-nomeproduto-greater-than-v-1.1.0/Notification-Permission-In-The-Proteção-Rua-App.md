# Notification Permission in the Proteção Rua App

**ID: US-BTC-379**

In the Proteção Rua app, when you grant the Screen Time permission, a screen will appear explaining why it is important to enable notifications. To proceed, click "Continue," which will prompt you to enable notifications. If you choose "Don't Allow," a warning will offer the option to "Continue" to open the settings and adjust manually or "Do Later" to proceed without enabling notifications at that moment. By choosing "Continue," you will be taken to the settings where you can manually adjust the permissions. If you choose "Do Later," you will move on to the next step of the app. If you initially deny the permission, there will be future opportunities to allow notifications again.
