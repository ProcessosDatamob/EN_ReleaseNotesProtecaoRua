# App Lock Outside Secure Location

**US ID:** **US-BTC-574**

**Description:** In the application, there is an issue where apps configured to be locked outside a secure location are not being correctly locked. This means that even if you have set the apps to be restricted in unauthorized locations, they can still be accessed in these areas. The functionality should ensure that upon leaving a secure location, the designated apps are automatically locked, preventing their use in unauthorized locations. This flaw affects the ability to restrict app usage according to the permitted location.
