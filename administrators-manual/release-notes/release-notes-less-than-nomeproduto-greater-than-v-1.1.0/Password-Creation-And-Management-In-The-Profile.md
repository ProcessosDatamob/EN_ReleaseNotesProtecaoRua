# Password Creation and Management in the Profile

**ID: US-BTC-425**

In the Street Protection App, users have the option to create passwords directly in their profile when they access it for the first time. Initially, they see the "Create Passwords" option, which allows them to register passwords and add emergency contacts. Once this step is completed, the option changes to "Manage Passwords," enabling users to make changes as needed. This ensures that when selecting "Configure Your Protections" on the home screen, the user is guided to the next steps that still need to be completed after the initial password registration.
