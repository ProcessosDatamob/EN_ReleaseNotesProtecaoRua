# Safe Location Registration in the App

**ID: US-BTC-383**

Description: In the app, after the user sets up their passwords and contacts, they can add a safe location by clicking on the "Configure Your Protections" option on the home screen. If the user has already registered a safe location in the "Locations" section, this option will not be displayed on the home screen. Alternatively, the user can still access the "Locations" section directly to register a safe location without needing to use the home screen option. This ensures that the app functions properly and that all security features are available to the user.
