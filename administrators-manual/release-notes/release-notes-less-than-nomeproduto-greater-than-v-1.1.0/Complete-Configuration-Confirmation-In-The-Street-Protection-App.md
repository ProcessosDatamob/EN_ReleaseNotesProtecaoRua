# Complete Configuration Confirmation in the Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-397**

Description: When you finish setting up the Street Protection app, whether by completing all the steps or skipping some, the feedback screen will inform you that everything is ready to use. If you are in a safe location that you have already registered, the Master Switch will be turned off when you return to the home screen. If you are outside these safe locations, the Master Switch will remain on. This helps ensure that the application is configured correctly.
