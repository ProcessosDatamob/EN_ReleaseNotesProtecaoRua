# Trusted Contact Registration

**User Story ID: US-BTC-423**

Description: In the app, you can add trusted contacts through an invitation on the home screen. First, set your emergency password, and then you will be directed to include your contacts. You can manually enter the number or choose someone from your contact list. The "Continue" button will become available once you enter a valid number, allowing you to proceed to add a second contact. If you choose not to add a second contact, you can proceed to the next settings or return to the home screen, provided there are no more steps to complete.
