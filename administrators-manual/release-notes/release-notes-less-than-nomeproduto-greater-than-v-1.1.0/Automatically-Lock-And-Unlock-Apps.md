# Automatically Lock and Unlock Apps

**US ID: US-BTC-511**

Description: In the Street Protection app, you can choose which apps you want to automatically lock when you leave locations you've defined as safe. As soon as you return to these safe locations, the apps will be unlocked. This helps maintain your security continuously, allowing you to define the places where you feel safe and choose which apps should be monitored. The locking and unlocking occur automatically, ensuring that your protection works as needed for your peace of mind.
