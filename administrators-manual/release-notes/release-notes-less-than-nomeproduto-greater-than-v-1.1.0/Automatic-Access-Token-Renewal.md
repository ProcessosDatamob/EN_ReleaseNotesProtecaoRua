# Automatic Access Token Renewal

**ID: US-BTC-365**

In the Street Protection app, when your access token's usage time is almost up, the system will automatically generate a new token. This means you can continue using the app without having to log in repeatedly. If the token does expire and the renewal does not work for some reason, you will receive a notification and be taken directly to the login screen. This ensures that you can use the app continuously and without hassle.
