# Automatic Location Synchronization in the Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-68**

Description: In the Street Protection app, whenever you make changes to locations, such as adding, editing, or removing them, these changes are automatically updated with the management system as soon as the app detects an available internet connection. If the first synchronization attempt fails, the app will try again two more times. If you are without a connection, the changes will be stored on your device and sent as soon as the connection is restored. Throughout this process, the app's interface continues to function normally, allowing you to use the app without interruptions.
