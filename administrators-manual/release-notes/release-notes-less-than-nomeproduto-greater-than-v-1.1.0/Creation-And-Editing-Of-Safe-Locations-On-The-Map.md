# Creation and Editing of Safe Locations on the Map

**ID: US-BTC-338**

Description: In the Street Protection app, users can easily add and modify safe locations using the map. When they access the list of locations and choose the option to add or edit, the app displays a map with a fixed PIN at the center. Users can adjust the size of the safe area by changing the radius and can move the map around while the PIN remains at the center. It is also possible to use pinch gestures to zoom in or out on the map, ensuring that the safe area can be defined accurately. The map automatically adjusts to keep the safe area always visible when modifying the radius.
