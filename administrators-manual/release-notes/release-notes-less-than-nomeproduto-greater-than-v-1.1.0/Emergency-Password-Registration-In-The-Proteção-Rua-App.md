# Emergency Password Registration in the Proteção Rua App

**ID: US-BTC-420**

In the Proteção Rua app, you can create an emergency password by accessing a highlight on the home screen. This password is used for dangerous situations and does not share your location. When entering the registration screen, you need to create and confirm a simple password, which must be different from your main password. If the passwords do not match or are the same as the main password, error messages will appear and the registration will not be completed.
