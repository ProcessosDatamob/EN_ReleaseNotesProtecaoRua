# Granting Usage Time Permission in the Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-375**

Description: In the Street Protection app, when you need to allow access to usage time, a screen will appear explaining why this permission is important. After reading the explanation, you can decide whether to allow it or not. If you grant the permission, the app will function normally; if not, a message will appear explaining why the permission is essential and offering the option to try again or postpone it. If you choose "Continue," you will be taken to your device's settings to grant the permission. If you choose "Do Later," the app will continue to function, but without this permission.
