# Application Selection in the Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-385**

Description: In the Street Protection app, when you start setting up your protections, a screen appears explaining why it is important to choose which apps you want to protect. After registering your passwords and setting your security contacts or locations, you will be automatically guided by the "Configure Your Protections" guide to choose the apps you want to protect, if you haven't done so already in the "Apps" tab. If you are already in the "Apps" tab, this initial explanation does not appear, making your navigation faster and more direct.
