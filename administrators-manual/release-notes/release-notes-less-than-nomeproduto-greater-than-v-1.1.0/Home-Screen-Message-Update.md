# Home Screen Message Update

**US ID: US-BTC-573**

In the app, after completing the initial steps such as onboarding, registering a safe location, and adding blocked applications, the message on the home screen may not update correctly to reflect these actions. Instead of showing the updated status, it may continue to display "Safe location not yet set," causing confusion about the current status of the configured safe locations.
