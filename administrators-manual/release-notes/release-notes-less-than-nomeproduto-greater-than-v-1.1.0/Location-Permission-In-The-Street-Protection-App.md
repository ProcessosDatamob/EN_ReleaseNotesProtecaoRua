# Location Permission in the Street Protection App

**ID: US-BTC-376**

**Description:** In the Street Protection app, after logging in, you will see an initial screen explaining why it is important to enable location services for the app to function correctly. By clicking "Continue," you will be prompted to allow access to your location. If you choose "Allow while using the app," everything will proceed normally. If you choose "Allow once" or "Don't allow," a warning will appear suggesting that you select the appropriate permission. If needed, you can go to your device settings to change the permission at any time. If you prefer, by clicking "Do it later," you can continue using the app without immediately allowing location access.
