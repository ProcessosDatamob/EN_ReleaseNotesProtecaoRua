# Main Password Registration via Incentive Card

**ID: US-BTC-381**

Description: In the Proteção Rua app, users have the option to set up a main password by accessing the home screen through a card called "Configure your protections." This password provides an extra layer of security to the app and allows the user to authorize future actions securely. If the user has already registered the main password through the Profile, clicking on the card will take them directly to the next configuration steps that still need to be completed, avoiding the repetition of the password registration process.
